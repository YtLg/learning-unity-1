# Learning-Unity
My first attempt at learning unity basics since my 6th form project.

## The tutorial

To learn unity again, I used the following tutorial:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM

From this I learnt multiple things, including, but not limited to:

- How to manipulate objects ( physics, movement, etc.)
- how unity handles object references
- How to create blueprints
- How to create & utilise UI

## to-do

After finishing the tutorial, they reccomended multiple things that I could do to discover and learn more about unity myself


- [X] add animation
- [X] Add sound
- [X] Add a game-over if out of bounds
- [X] Add a particle system generate moving background
- [ ] Add a title screen
- [ ] Add a way to save the score of the player
