# Learning-Unity
My first attempt at learning unity basics since my 6th form project.

## The tutorial

To learn unity again, I used the following tutorial:

From this I learnt multiple things, including, but not limited to:

- How to manipulate objects ( physics, movement, etc.)
- how unity handles object references
- How to create blueprints
- How to create & utilise UI

After finishing the tutorial, they reccomended multiple things that I could do to discover and learn more about unity myself

- [x] finish the game ( tutorial)
- [X] add animation
- [ ] Add sound
- [X] Add a game-over if out of bounds
- [ ] Add a particle system generate moving background
- [ ] Add a title screen
